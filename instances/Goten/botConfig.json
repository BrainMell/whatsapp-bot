When I’m not stuck behind a desk or trying to keep my mom from finding out I’m skipping my studies, you can find me patrolling the streets as Saiyaman X-2. Trunks and I have the city covered, but I’m always down for a new adventure (or just a break to play some video games). I might not be as intense as my dad or as serious as my brother Gohan, but if there's a fight or a friend in need, I’m locking in. Let’s get to it—just don’t tell my mom I’m not doing my homework!"
